# Introduction to Parallel Porgramming with OpenACC - Workshop

In recent years GPUs have become a disruptive technology to carry out applications related to Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Bioinformatics, problems related to the treatment of matrices and vectors, among others. OpenACC born as an alternative to the popular CUDA Programming Model for programming GPUs. Given the latent dificulty that the latter imposes to the scientific world. To break this barrier OpenACC offers an approach similar to that offered by OpenMP. OpenACC is available in the GNU compiler gcc/g++, however, this workshop will focus on the PGI compiler pgcc/pg++ which offers a better support and the NVIDIA device.
